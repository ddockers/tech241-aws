DevOps is a combination of two words - development and operations. DevOps is the practice of automating and integrating the processes between development and operations.

The main goal in DevOps is to increase efficiency and speed of an organisation when it comes to delivering end products, such as applications and services.

## Why is DevOps needed?
Before DevOps as a concept was introduced, developers could be working on a project for years before a viable product could be presented to a client. 

When a project is just "code", it is of no value to a company. If it takes a long time for a product to be able to be deployed, it may then be obsolete as it could no longer meet a client's needs.



Here are some of the reasons why DevOps is important when it comes to delivering a product:

- Smaller cycles of production, faster innovation
- Reduced Deployment Delays, Rollbacks, and Times to Recovery
- Improved interaction and cooperation
- Increased performance
- Reduced expense and IT staff
- More constant deployment

When creating an application or service, the end goal is to deliver a viable product to end users.

A DevOps team helps to accelerate the development lifecycle with continuous delivery of changes and and endless cycle of improvements.
